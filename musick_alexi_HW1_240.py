# Problem 2.

'''
2. Investigate the relative efficiency of multiplying two one-dimensional NumPy arrays, a and b. 
You arrays should be large and with non-constant content. Do this in four distinct ways: (a) sum(a*b), (b) np.sum(a*b),
(c) np.dot(a,b), (d) a@b. You are advised to use the default timer() function from the
timeit module to compare the efficiency of different methods. To produce meaningful
results, repeat the calculations several thousands of times (at least).

# Problem 9.

'''
The Catalan numbers Cn are a sequence of integers
1,1,2,5,14,42,132... that play an important role in quantum mechanics and the theory
of disordered systems. (They were central to Eugene Wignerâ€™s proof of the so-called
semicircle law.) They are given by:

    C_0 = 1, C_n1 = ((4n+2)/(n+2))Cn

Write a program that prints in increasing order all Catalan numbers less than
or equal to one billion.
